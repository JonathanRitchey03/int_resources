### 💻 Get Used to Online Code Editors

- 🧠 _Using an online editor is much more challenging than using an IDE. It's necessary to know methods by heart, there's often no automatic code completion, and is a new skill and in of itself!!!_

- 🚀_A quick way to get started to go to the [CoderPad Sandbox](https://coderpad.io/resources/docs/for-candidates/interview-preparation-guide/sandbox/) and select your language._

### 📚 Memorize Language Constructs & Methods

- _Create a program in your language with all the top methods for basic string handling, array handling, basic math methods, list methods, built-in sorting, higher-order methods, and anything else you anticipate getting in an interview._

- _You can get ChatGPT to create this for you if needed._

### 🧪 Add Test Cases before Solving Problem

- _A quick win is to demonstrate test-driven development, by quickly adding test cases that exercise your solution before even writing it, first for trivial cases, and then for simple cases, and finally basic cases._

### 🔍 Add Tracing Code into Solution

- _While coding the solution, instead of adding tracing code after something goes wrong, add it in while writing the solution, so when it's run, the trace is output on the very first run!_ 

### 📄 Create a Basic DSA Reference Sheet

- _Ask ChatGPT to create a basic reference with extremely concise algorithms for linked list traversal, tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order, level-order), binary search, etc._

- _Ask ChatGPT to list the big-O complexity for different data structure operations in your language._

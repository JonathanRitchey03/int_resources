## 🧠 Practice Verbally Solving an Algorithm

### 🗣️ Restate and Work Through the Problem Verbally

- 🧩 _Examine any edge cases, talk about general approach and its expected complexity._  
- 🧱 _What data structures are needed?_  
- ⏱️ _What will their time complexity be?_  
- 🔍 _How can the problem be simplified?_

---

## 🧪 Write Test Cases before Solving Problem

- ✍️ _Go ahead and make your function signature if it's not already supplied._  
- 🧾 _Create a set of at least 4 test cases including a trivial test case, basic test case, edge case, and anything else._  
- 👣 _Make your test cases as simple and easy to trace as possible while still covering functionality._

---

## 🔍 Include Tracing Statements in Initial Solution

- 📢 _Include intuitive tracing statements in your solution so that when it's run, it will include tracing statements._

---

## 🧰 If Needed, Start Simple and Incrementally Solve All Cases

- 🌱 _Sometimes the complete solution isn't obvious. Work up incrementally._

---

## 🛑 Take Time to Understand Any Errors

- 🧠 _When something goes wrong, pause and take a moment to understand the syntax error and unexpected output._
